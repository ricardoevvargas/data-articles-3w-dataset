## The Data Article

### Title ‚úÖ

3W Dataset 2.0.0: a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells

### Abstract ‚úÖ

In the oil industry, undesirable events in oil wells can cause economic losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based solutions for Early Detection of such events have proven valuable for diverse applications across industries. In 2019, recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to undesirable events in oil wells, Petrobras developed and publicly released the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is essentially a set of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been developed collaboratively and has become a foundational reference for numerous works in the field. This data article describes the current publicly available version of the 3W Dataset, which contains structural modifications and additional labeled data. The detailed description provided encourages and supports the 3W Community and new 3W users to improve previous published results and to develop new robust methodologies, digital products and services capable of detecting undesirable events in oil wells with enough anticipation to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary ‚úÖ

Undesirable events cause different types of damage to the oil industry, including economic losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties [[1]](#1).

Abnormal Event Management (AEM) refers to systematic detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of unexpected or irregular events within complex industrial systems [[2]](#2). In the oil industry, where operational safety, environmental protection, and economic performance are tightly coupled, AEM is crucial for minimizing the impact of undesirable events. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based solutions into AEM have shown promise for Early Detection [[3]](#3) of undesirable events in different industries [[4]](#4). By analyzing vast streams of operational data, such as pressure, temperature, vibration, and flow rates, algorithms can uncover subtle patterns that precede abnormal conditions, allowing early intervention and preventive maintenance strategies [[5]](#5). A requirement that is recognized as essential in this type of approach is the use of high-quality datasets [[6]](#6) [[7]](#7).

In 2019, Petrobras ‚Äî the largest oil company in Brazil, which operates in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation of oil, natural gas, and energy ‚Äî recognized this need and then developed and published the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is described in detail by Vargas et al. [[8]](#8). 

The 3W Dataset is a collection of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) [[9]](#9)[[10]](#10), referred to as instances, which have been labeled by experts from Petrobras and its partners. The name "3W" was chosen because the dataset comprises instances derived from ***3*** different sources (real, simulated, and hand-drawn) which contains undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells. Each instance may either represent 100% of the data associated with normal operating conditions or contain data partially related to a specific type of undesirable event. The core idea behind the dataset is to enable the learning (modeling) of temporal patterns or signatures across multiple variables, distinguishing between normal conditions and various types of undesirable events.

The main features of the 3W Dataset are as follows. Its real instances correspond to data collected directly from real industrial environments. Characteristics such as frozen variables, missing variables, and outliers are intentionally left untreated. Thos approach aims to to encourage and enable the development of methodologies and digital products capable of dealing with real-world challenges. By preserving these typical characteristics, the dataset maintains a high level of quality and realism. Simulated instances have been added because some types of undesirable events are rare in real-world operations. Hand-drawn instances have been added to address events that are not only rare but also challenging to simulate. Experts can use their understanding of variable behaviors during such events to manually create these instances to mirror real-world conditions as closely as possible.

Due to its features, the 3W Dataset can also serve as a foundational resource for training basic models in Transfer Learning frameworks [[11]](#11). These frameworks rely on a large, generalized dataset as a reference or starting point for training models to address different but related challenges, particularly when an adequate training dataset for the target task is unavailable. This approach is widely used in Deep Learning [[12]](#12), especially in scenarios requiring large amounts of training data.

The 3W Dataset is managed using Semantic Versioning [[13]](#13), with its initial release designated as version 1.0.0.

Since its initial release, the 3W Dataset has been explored by several people who make up the 3W Community [[14]](#14), including independent professionals and representatives of research institutions, startups, companies, and oil operators from different countries. 

The 3W Community has contributed to the development and publication of numerous works, forming a substantial scientific framework focused on the Early Detection of undesirable events in oil wells. This framework is composed by books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs. Publications identified so far that cite the 3W Dataset are listed in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

In 2022, Petrobras officially launched the 3W Project as the inaugural pilot of the Open Lab Module within the Connections for Innovation Program [[16]](#16). The purpose of this module is to encourage open and collaborative project development on the Internet, particularly through the GitHub platform [[17]](#17). Since then, the 3W Dataset has been maintained and developed in its dedicated corporate Git repository [[15]](#15) on GitHub.

As part of the 3W Project, the same Git repository also hosts the 3W Toolkit, a software package developed in Python 3 [[18]](#18). The toolkit is designed to facilitate and encourage the exploration of the 3W Dataset, as well as the development and comparison of different methodological approaches.

In addition to its two main resources ‚Äî the 3W Dataset and the 3W Toolkit ‚Äî the 3W Project repository also provides:

- A detailed description of the motivation, strategy, ambition, governance, and other aspects of the 3W Project;
- A list of at least 100 published works that cite the 3W Dataset;
- Specifications of priority challenges (benchmarks);
- The 3W Project contributing guide;
- Information about the 3W Community;
- Overviews of the 3W Dataset developed by the 3W Community;
- The 3W Community code of conduct;
- Release notes for the published versions of the 3W Dataset.

Since 2022, the 3W Dataset has been evolved under Petrobras' leadership, with its current publicly available version designated as 2.0.0.

This data article describes the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 and summarizes the advancements  incorporated since version 1.0.0. The detailed description is intended to encourage and support the established 3W Community and also new users to improve previously published results and develop innovative methodologies, digital products and services. These advancements aim  to enable the early detection of undesirable events in oil wells, allowing for timely corrective or mitigating actions.

### Methods ‚ÅâÔ∏è

> üëç Figure improvements.

In summary, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is composed of three types of instances generated by three methods, one per type of instance. These methods are described in this section and are based on the mathematical definition of MTS presented in the following subsection. According to this definition and to support both the 3W Project and this article, a nomenclature was developed and is detailed in the subsequent subsection. The types of instances and the methods associated with them are described in their own subsections. Some characteristics are common to the three methods and are, therefore, detailed in a separate subsection.

#### Mathematical Definition of Multivariate Time Series

The definition chosen for MTS is consistent with the one presented in the article that introduced the 3W Dataset version 1.0.0 [[8]](#8). This definition is reproduced below.

A dataset ***DS*** is a set of _m_ MTS (S<sup>_i_</sup> | _i_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _m_}, ‚àÄ _m_ ‚àà Z, and _m_ > 1) and is defined as ***DS*** = {***S***<sup>1</sup>, ***S***<sup>2</sup>, ‚Ä¶, ***S***<sup>_m_</sup>}. Each MTS _i_ is an instance composed of a set of _n_ univariate time series (x<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j_</sub> | _j_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _n_}, ‚àÄ _n_ ‚àà Z, and _n_ > 1) (also referenced as process variable or just variable), and is defined as ***S***<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2</sub>, ‚Ä¶, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_</sub>}. Each variable _j_ that composes an MTS _i_ is an ordered temporal sequence of _p_<sub>_i_</sub> observations taken at the time _t_ (_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j,t_</sub> | _t_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _p_<sub>_i_</sub>}, ‚àÄ _p_<sub>_i_</sub> ‚àà Z, and _p_<sub>_i_</sub> > 1). Therefore, each MTS _i_ is defined in this work as a matrix defined as S<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,1</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,1</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,2</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,2</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,2</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>}.

Note that all instances have a fixed number of variables _n_; all instances are composed of the same _n_ variables; each instance can be composed of any number of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>; all _n_ variables of an instance _i_ have a fixed number of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>; and different instances can be composed of different numbers of observations.

#### Nomenclature

The nomenclature used in this work is derived from the definition of MTS provided in the previous subsection. The specific terms and their descriptions are presented in Table 1.

**Table 1**<br>Terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work.
| **Term** | **Meaning** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Variable | A physical quantity at a specific point in the production system of a particular well, from which measurements are acquired to produce a univariate time series _j_: _x_<sub>_j_</sub> |
| Timestamp | Instant _t_ (date + time) at which values are acquired or generated and then associated with variables: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| Observation | Vector with values from _n_ variables of a single instance _i_ acquired at a timestamp _t_: {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,t</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,t</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,t</sub>} |
| Label | Annotation provided by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of a particular property. The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 includes two types of labels which are defined below: class label and state label. The labeling process is explained in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| Class label | Annotation provided by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of normality or the occurrence of an undesirable event. See additional explanation in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| State label | Annotation provided by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of operational status. See additional explanation in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| Sample | Part of an MTS, including all _n_ variables and all observations between two timestamps |
| Period | A sample that respects the following two conditions: all its observations are labeled with the same class label and it is not contained in another temporally larger sample with all observations labeled with the same class label. In other words, a period is the largest possible sample whose observations are labeled with the same class label |
| Instance | Collection of temporally sequential periods associated with a specific well |
| Type of event | Operational state in which a well can be found, including normality, failures, and undesired states |
| Dataset | Set of instances with multiple types of events |

#### Types of Instances

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is composed of three types of instances, denoted as real, simulated, and hand-drawn.

Each type of instance has been defined based on the origin of its data.  Real instances were sourced from various Petrobras' Plant Information Management Systems (PIMS) [[19]](#19), specifically  different AVEVA PI System [[20]](#20) environments. Simulated instances were generated using OLGA [[21]](#21), a dynamic multiphase flow simulator widely adopted by oil companies worldwide. Hand-drawn instances were created by Petrobras experts and extracted using a digital tool developed exclusively for this purpose.

Each type of instance, and therefore each data source, required the development of its own method for acquiring and labeling data. The common characteristics among the three developed methods are described in the following subsection. The particularities of each method are detailed in the subsequent subsections.

#### Common Characteristics Among the Methods

All instances, regardless of their type, are related to satellite-type offshore oil-producing wells that operate without a manifold [[22]](#22). These wells can alternate between different lifting methods [[23]](#23) over time, utilizing either the natural method or an artificial lifting method. The natural method is employed when the reservoir pressure is sufficient to produce hydrocarbons at a commercially viable rate without the need for additional energy. When reservoir pressure is insufficient, an artificial lifting method is required to introduce extra energy into the system and maintain production.

Fig. 1 presents a diagram illustrating the scenario considered during the design of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. This diagram covers only the components necessary for a good understanding of how the dataset was conceived. In summary, it depicts the production platform, the well, the subsea Christmas tree [[24]](#24), the production and service lines, the electro-hydraulic umbilical, and sensors and valves.

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 contains 27 variables present in all instances. Following the adopted definition of MTS, each variable is included in an instance even if no data has been obtained or generated for that variable in a specific instance. Table 2 provides the name of each variable, its representation, and its physical position within the scenario depicted in Fig. 1.

**Table 2**<br>Details of the variables in the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.
| **Name** | **Description** | **Position** |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ABER-CKGL | Opening of the GLCK (gas lift choke) | 1.1 |
| ABER-CKP | Opening of the PCK (production choke) | 2.1 |
| ESTADO-DHSV | State of the DHSV (downhole safety valve) | 3.1 |
| ESTADO-M1 | State of the PMV (production master valve) | 4.1 |

| ESTADO-W1 | State of the PWV (production wing valve) | 9.1 |
| ESTADO-W2 | State of the AWV (annulus wing valve) | 10.1 |
| ESTADO-XO | State of the XO (crossover) valve | 11.1 |
| P-ANULAR | Pressure in the well annulus | 12.1 |
| P-JUS-BS | Downstream pressure of the SP (service pump) | 13.1 |
| P-JUS-CKGL | Downstream pressure of the GLCK | 1.2 |
| P-JUS-CKP | Downstream pressure of the PCK | 2.2 |
| P-MON-CKGL | Upstream pressure of the GLCK | 1.3 |
| P-MON-CKP | Upstream pressure of the PCK | 2.3 |
| P-MON-SDV-P | Upstream pressure of the production SDV | 8.2 |
| P-PDG | Pressure at the PDG (permanent downhole gauge) | 14.1 |
| PT-P | Downstream pressure of the PWV in the production tube | 4.2 |
| P-TPT | Pressure at the TPT (temperature and pressure transducer) | 15.1 |
| QBS | Flow rate at the SP | 13.2 |
| QGL | Gas lift flow rate | 13.3 |
| T-JUS-CKP | Downstream temperature of the PCK | 2.4 |
| T-MON-CKP | Upstream temperature of the PCK | 2.5 |
| T-PDG | Temperature at the PDG | 14.2 |
| T-TPT | Temperature at the TPT | 15.2 |

Note that some variable names contain terms or acronyms in Portuguese. For example: ABER = abertura = opening; CKGL = GLCK; CKP = PCK; ESTADO = state; ANULAR = annulus; JUS = jusante = downstream; and MON = montante = upstream. Translating all these names into English is a pending issue that will be resolved in future versions of 3W Dataset.

All instances were generated with observations recorded every 1 second, resulting in a fixed sampling frequency of 1 Hz. This sampling refers to data retrieval through the PI System, with some observations being interpolated to ensure a consistent time series.

All variables corresponding to a given physical quantity (type of variable) are expressed using the same measurement unit, as specified in Table 3.

**Table 3**<br>Physical quantities and their measurement units.
| **Physical Quantity** | **Measurement Unit** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Choke opening | % |
| Flow rate | m<sup>3</sup>/s | 
| Pressure | Pa |
| Temperature | ¬∫C |
| Valve state | Adimensional: 0 for closed, 1 for open, and 0.5 for any other state |

The labeling process applied to all instances of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 resulted in two types of labels: class labels and state labels. Class labels are associated with normal conditions or the occurrence of undesirable events, while state labels are related to the operational status of the respective well.

The codes corresponding to the class labels are detailed in Table 4. Any of these codes can be assigned to any observation from any instance. Codes 101 to 109 represent transient conditions between normal operation and steady states associated with undesirable events. It is important to note that not all undesirable events have corresponding transient conditions. When the well condition in terms of normality or the occurrence of an undesirable event is unknown at any time, the associated observation is labeled with the class label Unknown (code = NaN = Not a Number). Additionally, each instance, as a whole, is associated with a single steady state code (from 1 to 9) that corresponds to at least part of its observations. This code is referred to as the "type of event."

**Table 4** <br>Class labels and their codes.

The following are succinct descriptions of each type of event:

- 1: Abrupt Increase of BSW: A sudden rise in Basic Sediment and Water ratio, potentially leading to flow assurance issues, reduced oil production, and operational challenges.
- 2 Spurious Closure of DHSV: An unexpected closure of Downhole Safety Valve (DHSV), risking production losses.
- 3 Severe Slugging: Periodic and intense flow instability that can damage equipment and disrupt operations.
- 4 Flow Instability: Non-periodic flow disturbances that, if unaddressed, may escalate into severe slugging.
- 5: Rapid Productivity Loss: A sudden decrease in well productivity, often driven by changes in system properties.
- 6: Quick Restriction in PCK: A rapid and significant restriction in the production choke valve, typically caused by operational challenges.
- 7: Scaling in PCK: Formation of inorganic deposits in the production choke valve, reducing oil and gas production.
- 8: Hydrate in Production Line: Formation of crystalline compounds (hydrates) that can block pipelines, leading to significant production losses and high unblocking costs.
- 9: Hydrate in Service Line: Similar to event 8, but occurring in the service line, leading to distinct signature patterns in operational data.

For further details on these events, please refer to Vargas et al. [[8]](#8).

The codes associated with the state labels are detailed in Table 5. These codes can be associated with any observation from any instance, but they are not associated with an instance as a whole. If the well's operating condition is unknown at any given time, the respective observation is assigned the state label Unknown (code = NaN).

**Table 5** <br>State labels and their codes.
| **State Label** | **Code** |
|---------|--------|
| Open | 0 |
| Shut-In | 1 |
| Flushing Diesel | 2 |
| Flushing Gas | 3 |
| Bullheading | 4 |
| Closed With Diesel | 5 |
| Closed With Gas | 6 |
| Restart | 7 |
| Depressurization | 8 |
| Unknown | NaN |

Each operational status is defined based on the configuration of the valves and the nature of recent or ongoing operations. In summary, the statuses are as follows:

- Open: all production valves (M1, W1, SDV-P, and PCK) are open, and auxiliary valves (PXO, and XO) are closed;
- Shut-in: at least one valve in the production path is closed;
- Flushing Diesel: at least one wellhead valve is closed, PXO or XO is open, and diesel is injected;
- Flushing Gas: at least one wellhead valve is closed, PXO or XO is open, and gas is injected;
- Bullheading: all production valves are open, and diesel is injected from the topside through the production line;
- Closed With Diesel: at least one production valve is closed, and the previous state was Flushing Diesel or Bullheading;
- Closed With Gas: at least one production valve is closed, and the previous state was Flushing Gas;
- Restart: following a shut-in, all production valves are reopened;
- Depressurization: following a shut-in, SDV-P and PCK are open, while M1, W1, PXO, and XO remain closed.

Understanding and correctly identifying these operational status is critical in monitoring and preventing undesirable events. Some important additional explanations are as follows:

- Open state denotes continuous production with all key production path valves open and no auxiliary operations ongoing;
- All operational status other than Open are associated with well Shut-in procedures;
- Closed With Diesel state occurs following successful Flushing Diesel or Bullheading, during which the well is filled with diesel (a condition in which hydrate formation is highly unlikely);
- Bullheading is performed by injecting fluid (diesel) directly from the topside into the production line under pressure, pushing the wellbore fluids back into the reservoir. This operation is used to ensure that a non-hydrate-forming fluid fills the system, often as a preventive action against hydrate plugs;
- Flushing Diesel, in contrast, is performed by circulating diesel through the service line and into the production flowline, displacing the original production fluids along the flowline path, typically toward the topside facilities. This operation ensures that hydrate-prone fluids are replaced with a more stable medium, reducing the chances of hydrate formation during shut-in;
- Closed With Gas state occurs following a Flushing Gas operation, which is performed by injecting and circulating gas (usually dry gas) via the service line into the production line. This operation also serves to remove liquid hydrocarbons or water that could contribute to hydrate formation, creating a drier environment inside the pipeline;
- Additionally, historical operational context can be valuable; for instance, depressurizing the production system is a typical measure performed shortly after the well is shut-in, in order to seek for thermodynamic conditions less favorable to the formation of hydrates;
- Depressurization state may indicate that subcooling levels were reduced, potentially mitigating hydrate risks during extended shut-ins.

#### Method Relating to Real Instances

The particularities of the method developed for generating real data are listed below.

* Data acquisition:
    1. Data is sourced from Petrobras' PIMS [[19]](#19), specifically from various AVEVA PI System [[20]](#20) environments;
    1. Linear interpolation provided by the AVEVA PI System is applied to simulate a fixed acquisition frequency of 1 Hz;
    1. No treatment is performed for frozen variables or missing values√ß
    1. Data is converted to standard measurement units.
* Data labeling:
    1. Historical records are mapped in a Tracking System to ensure accessibility and traceability for labelers (experts from Petrobras and its partners);
    1. Labelers use a Petrobras-developed Web Tool to label and export real data to the 3W Dataset;
    1. An expert committee (Validators) reviews the labeling, suggests potential adjustments, and validates the assigned labels;
    1. A Curator (a 3W Dataset specialist) finalizes the labeling process by updating the tool to mark validated events (instances) as labeled, enabling their exportation and inclusion in the 3W Dataset;
    1. Fig. 2 illustrates the labeling process and Fig. 3 provides an example of a labeled real instance.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. It covers only events that occurred in real life and had archived records;
1. Contextualization (mappings between variables and tags in PIMS) was not verified;
1. Original measurement units configured in PIMS (before conversions) were not verified.

  </tr>
</table>

#### Method Relating to Simulated Instances

The particularities of the method developed for simulated data are listed below.

* Data generation:
    1. A matrix of simulations was planned with OLGA [[21]](#21), gradually varying the main parameters of the considered scenario;
    1. Simulations were run, and results that did not converge (e.g., wells that did not produce normally) were filtered out;
    1. Time series were automatically extracted from TPL files generated by OLGA, corresponding to successful simulations;
    1. Time series are perfectly periodic;
    1. No frozen variables or missing values are present;
    1. Variables are represented with standardized measurement units;
    1. No noise is introduced in the time series.
* Data labeling:
    1. Labeling is fully automated based on simulation results, including transient periods.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. The method uses a single phenomenological model in OLGA associated with a single well;
1. A simplified simulation strategy was employed. For example, hydrates were simulated using a valve with a linear closing percentage;
1. Some variables were not included in the simulations, resulting in all their values being considered missing across all simulated instances.

#### Method Relating to Hand-Drawn Instances

The particularities of the method developed for hand-drawn data are listed below.

* Data generation:
    1. A proprietary tool based on image processing was developed exclusively for generating hand-drawn data for the 3W Dataset;
    1. Each variable was hand-drawn on its own chart by an expert from Petrobras. An example is shown in Fig. 4;
    1. Time series were automatically digitized by scanning graphs printed on paper;
    1. Time series are perfectly periodic;
    1. No frozen variables or missing values are present;
    1. Variables are represented with standardized measurement units.
* Data labeling:
    1. Labels were derived from expert markings on the graphs printed on paper, including transient periods.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. The method covers only well-known signatures of the considered undesirable events;
1. There is potential for expert bias when drawing and labeling time series;
1. The process depends on the expert's manual dexterity.

| Frozen Variables | 6095 | 9.77% of 62384 |
| Unlabeled Observations | 4028400 | 5.26% of 76587318 |

#### 3W Dataset 2.0.0 Structure

In the root of the directory containing the dataset, there is a file called dataset.ini, which specifies the properties of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. The proposal is for all users to concentrate their searches for these properties in this file.

The data itself is organized into subdirectories dedicated to each type of event. The name of each directory corresponds to the code associated with each event type (see Table 6).

Each instance is stored in its own Apache Parquet file [[27]](#27), or simply Parquet file. Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It supports high-performance compression and encoding schemes, allowing it to handle complex data in bulk. It is also supported in many programming languages and analytics tools.

The logic for formulating file names depends on the type of instance.

- **Real Instances:**  
  File names follow the format: WELL-[incremental id]_[timestamp of oldest observation].parquet.  
  Example: WELL-00014_20170917140000.parquet.  
  Each real well is associated with a unique ID, regardless of the event type (subdirectory). As each real well can give rise to one or multiple instances, the [timestamp of oldest observation] ensures unique identification.

- **Simulated Instances:**  
  File names follow the format: SIMULATED_[incremental id].parquet.  
  Example: SIMULATED_00072.parquet.  
  The incremental ID starts at 1 for each type of event (subdirectory) and is sufficient to uniquely identify all simulated instances.

- **Hand-Drawn Instances:**  
  File names follow the format: DRAWN_[incremental id].parquet.  
  Example: DRAWN_00007.parquet.  
  The incremental ID starts at 1 for each type of event (subdirectory) and is sufficient to uniquely identify all hand-drawn instances.

All Parquet files are created with the Pyarrow engine [[28]](#28) and the Brotli compression [[29]](#29). These choices provide a good compromise between compression ratio and read performance.

The timestamp vector of each instance is used as the index in the corresponding Parquet file. All timestamps are represented in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.

All variables and labels are stored as columns in the Parquet files, variables as float and labels as Int64 (not int64).

### Technical Validation ‚úÖ

Several carefully incorporated features in the methods described in the Methods Section ensure the high-technical quality of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. The main features are as follows:

* Real instances: maintenance of real data characteristics, labeling by experts, and validation by expert committee;
* Simulated instances: simulation models calibrated by experts and systematized labeling;
* Hand-drawn instances: hand-drawn graphs by experts and systematized labeling.

The experts mentioned here are all from Petrobras and its partners.

The quantity and the diversity of the works developed and published by the 3W Community demonstrate the relevance and the high technical quality of the 3W Dataset. This scientific framework includes dozens of published works, such as books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs. The quantitative annual progress of these publications to date is shown in Fig. 6. Over the years, the adoption of the 3W Dataset by the 3W Community has steadily increased, highlighting its relevance, accessibility, and practical applicability in advancing AEM systems. More information on these works can be found in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

### Usage Notes ‚úÖ

This data article describes the 3W Dataset 2.0.0, the latest publicly available version, and summarizes its evolution from version 1.0.0, as previously detailed by Vargas et al. [[8]](#8).

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was generated with Python 3.10 [[18]](#18) code, using mainly resources provided by the Pandas 1.5 [[30]](#30) and Pyarrow 19.0 [[28]](#28) packages. 

Designed for cross-platform compatibility, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 can be analyzed using virtually any programming language‚Äînot limited to Python. However, regardless of the language, the Apache Parquet files [[27]](#27) should be accessed using the Pyarrow engine [[28]](#28) alongside Brotli compression [[29]](#29).

When comparing results obtained in different works, it is important to distinguish which versions of the 3W Dataset were used. Due to substantial differences among the published versions, certain comparisons may pose challenges and require careful consideration.

The main updates introduced in version 2.0.0, compared to version 1.0.0, are summarized below. More details can be found in the release notes available in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

1. The dataset structure has been significantly revised. Data is now stored in Parquet files instead of CSV files;
1. One variable (T-JUS-CKGL) has been discontinued and 20 others have been added, resulting in 27 variables in the current version;
1. One new type of undesirable event has been added: Hydrate in Service Line;
1. The number of real instances has increased by 94;
1. The number of simulated instances has increased by 150;
1. The number of real wells covered has doubled, increasing from 21 to 42;
1. A new label, the "state label," has been added.
1. More labeled observations have been incorporated across several instances;
1. No significant changes have been made to simulated or hand-drawn instances. All 20 new variables were incorporated into these instances with missing values.

The operational status of a well, represented by the state label, is strongly correlated with the values of its variables. This allows algorithms to be applied to the 3W Dataset for quantifying these relationships. Additionaly, the state label can be used to select data for specific training purposes.

### Code Availability ‚úÖ

The 3W Project also develops and maintains the 3W Toolkit, a publicly available software package hosted in its Git repository [[15]](#15). Written in Python 3 [[18]](#18) and licensed under Apache 2.0 [[31]](#31), the toolkit is designed to facilitate and encourage the exploration of the 3W Dataset as well as the development and evaluation of comparative approaches. It provides a range of features for loading data, visualizing time series, calculating metrics, and more. Python practitioners can therefore use and adapt the 3W Toolkit to speed up their analysis with the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.

An in-depth description of the 3W Toolkit is beyond the scope of this data article, but its documentation and examples of use can be found in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).
