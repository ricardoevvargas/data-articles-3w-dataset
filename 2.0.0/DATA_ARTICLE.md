## The Data Article

### Title ‚úÖ

3W Dataset 2.0.0: a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells

### Abstract ‚úÖ

In the oil industry, undesirable events in oil wells can cause economic losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Early Detection of such events have proven valuable for diverse applications across industries. In 2019, recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to undesirable events in oil wells, Petrobras developed and publicly released the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is essentially a set of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been developed collaboratively and has become a foundational reference for numerous works in the field. This data article describes the current publicly available version of the 3W Dataset, which contains structural modifications and additional labeled data. The detailed description provided encourages and supports the 3W community and new 3W users to improve previous published results and to develop new robust methodologies, digital products and services capable of detecting undesirable events in oil wells with enough anticipation to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary ‚úÖ

Undesirable events cause different types of damage to the oil industry, including economic losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties [[1]](#1).

Abnormal Event Management (AEM) refers to systematic detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of unexpected or irregular events within complex industrial systems [[2]](#2). In the oil industry, where operational safety, environmental protection, and economic performance are tightly coupled, AEM is crucial for minimizing the impact of undesirable events. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based solutions into AEM have shown promise for Early Detection [[3]](#3) of undesirable events across different industries [[4]](#4). By analyzing large streams of operational data, such as pressure, temperature, vibration, and flow rates, algorithms can identify subtle patterns that precede abnormal conditions, allowing early intervention and preventive maintenance strategies [[5]](#5). An essential requirement for the success of this type of approach is the use of high-quality datasets [[6]](#6) [[7]](#7).

This need was recognized by Petrobras ‚Äî the largest oil company in Brazil, operating in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation of oil, natural gas, and energy [[32]](#32) ‚Äî which developed the 3W Dataset and published its first version in 2019, as described in detail by Vargas et al. [[8]](#8). 

The 3W Dataset is essentially a set of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) [[9]](#9)[[10]](#10), also called instances, labeled by experts from Petrobras and its partners. The name 3W was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from ***3*** different sources (real, simulated, and hand-drawn) and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells. Each instance can contain 100% of the data relating to normality or part of the data relating to a single type of undesirable event. The basic idea is that temporal signatures between multiple variables of each type of event and normality can be learned (modeled) from a set of MTS.

The main features of the 3W Dataset are as follows. Its real instances correspond to real industrial environments. Frozen variables, missing variables, outliers, etc. are intentionally left untreated. The idea is to encourage and enable the development of methodologies and digital products capable of dealing with real adversities. Therefore, it has been advocated that the preservation of such characteristics can result in datasets that are faithful to real industrial environments and particularly useful [[33]](#33). Simulated instances have been added because some types of undesirable events are rare in real life. Hand-drawn instances have been added because some rare events are complicated to simulate and experts are familiar with the variables' behavior during these events.

Due to its features, the 3W Dataset can also be used to train basic models in Transfer Learning Frameworks [[11]](#11). This kind of framework rely on a large and general dataset as a reference or starting point for training a model to solve a different but related challenge, particularly when an adequate training dataset of its own is unavailable. This approach is commonly used in Deep Learning Applications [[12]](#12), especially those requiring large amounts of training data.

As the 3W Dataset has been managed with Semantic Versioning [[13]](#13), its first version is identified by the code 1.0.0.

Since its first publication, the 3W Dataset has been explored by several people who make up the 3W Community [[14]](#14), including independent professionals and representatives of research institutions, startups, companies, and oil operators from different countries. 

Several works that have been developed and published by the 3W Community has formed a considerable scientific framework related to Early Detection of undesirable events in oil wells. This framework is composed by books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs. Publications identified so far that cite the 3W Dataset are listed in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

In 2022, Petrobras created the 3W Project as the first pilot of the Open Lab Module of the *Connections Program for Innovation* [[16]](#16). The purpose of this module is to encourage open and collaborative project developments on the Internet, more specifically through GitHub [[17]](#17). Since then, the 3W Dataset has been maintained and developed in its dedicated corporate Git repository [[15]](#15) on GitHub.

In this same Git repository and as part of the 3W Project, there is also the 3W Toolkit, which is a software package written in Python 3 [[18]](#18) whose purpose is to facilitate and encourage exploration of the 3W Dataset and proposals for comparative approaches.

In addition to these two main resources, 3W Dataset and 3W Toolkit, the 3W Project repository also provides:

- Detailed description of the motivation, strategy, ambition, governance, and other aspects of the 3W Project;
- Lists with at least 100 published works that cite the 3W Dataset;
- Specification of priority challenges (benchmarks);
- The 3W Project contributing guide;
- Information about the 3W Community;
- 3W Dataset overviews developed by the 3W Community;
- The 3W Community code of conduct;
- Release notes for the published versions of the 3W Dataset.

Since 2022, the 3W Dataset has been evolved under Petrobras' leadership, and its current publicly available version is identified by the code 2.0.0.

This data article describes the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 and summarizes the advances incorporated into this version since version 1.0.0. The detailed description provided encourages and supports the 3W Community and new 3W users to improve previous published results and to develop new robust methodologies, digital products and services capable of detecting undesirable events in oil wells with enough anticipation to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Methods ‚ÅâÔ∏è

> üëç Short description about each class label (after Table 4), and figure improvements.

In summary, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is composed of three types of instances generated by three methods, one per type of instance. These methods are described in this section and are based on the mathematical definition of MTS presented in the following subsection. According to this definition and to support both the 3W Project and this article, a nomenclature was developed and is detailed in the subsequent subsection. The types of instances and the methods associated with them are described in their own subsections. Some characteristics are common to the three methods and are, therefore, detailed in a separate subsection.

#### Mathematical Definition of Multivariate Time Series

The chosen definition for MTS is the same as that used in the article that published the 3W Dataset 1.0.0 [[8]](#8). This definition is reproduced below.

A dataset ***DS*** is a set of _m_ MTS (S<sup>_i_</sup> | _i_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _m_}, ‚àÄ _m_ ‚àà Z, and _m_ > 1) and is defined as ***DS*** = {***S***<sup>1</sup>, ***S***<sup>2</sup>, ‚Ä¶, ***S***<sup>_m_</sup>}. Each MTS _i_ is an instance that is composed of a set of _n_ univariate time series (x<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j_</sub> | _j_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _n_}, ‚àÄ _n_ ‚àà Z, and _n_ > 1) (also referenced as process variable or just variable), and is defined as ***S***<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2</sub>, ‚Ä¶, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_</sub>}. Each variable _j_ that composes an MTS _i_ is an ordered temporal sequence of _p_<sub>_i_</sub> observations taken at the time _t_ (_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j,t_</sub> | _t_ = {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, _p_<sub>_i_</sub>}, ‚àÄ _p_<sub>_i_</sub> ‚àà Z, and _p_<sub>_i_</sub> > 1). Therefore, each MTS _i_ is viewed in this work as a matrix defined as S<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,1</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,1</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,2</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,2</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,2</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>}.

Note that all instances have a fixed number of variables _n_; all instances are composed of the same _n_ variables; each instance can be composed of any number of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>; all _n_ variables of an instance _i_ have a fixed number of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>; and different instances can be composed of different number of observations.

#### The Developed Nomenclature

The terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work are derived from the definition of MTS presented in the previous subsection. These terms are presented in Table 1.

**Table 1**<br>Terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work.
| **Term** | **Meaning** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Variable | Physical quantity at a specific point in the production system of a specific well from which values are acquired to generate a univariable time series _j_: _x_<sub>_j_</sub> |
| Timestamp | Instant _t_ (date + time) at which values are acquired or generated and then associated with variables: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| Observation | Vector with values from _n_ variables of a single instance _i_ acquired at a timestamp _t_: {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,t</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,t</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,t</sub>} |
| Label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of a particular property. The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 has two labels which are defined below: class label and state label. The labeling process is explained in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| Class label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of occurrence of an undesirable event or normality. See additional explanation in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| State label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of operational status. See additional explanation in [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) Subsection |
| Sample | Part of an MTS, including all _n_ variables and all observations between two timestamps |
| Period | A sample that respects the following two conditions: all its observations are labeled with the same class label and it is not contained in another temporally larger sample with all observations labeled with the same class label. In other words, a period is the largest possible sample whose observations are labeled with the same class label |
| Instance | Collection of temporally sequential periods associated with a specific well |
| Type of event | Operational state in which a well can find itself, including normality, failures, and undesired states |
| Dataset | Set of instances with multiple types of events |

#### Types of Instances

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is composed of three types of instances, called real, simulated, and hand-drawn.

Each of these types of instances has been fundamentally defined according to the origin of its data. Data from real instances were obtained from different Petrobras' Plant Information Management Systems (PIMS) [[19]](#19), more precisely different AVEVA PI System [[20]](#20) environments. Data from simulated instances were generated with OLGA [[21]](#21), a dynamic multiphase flow simulator adopted by several oil companies around the globe. Data from hand-drawn instances were literally drawn by experts from Petrobras and extracted with a digital tool developed exclusively for this purpose.

Each type of instance, and therefore each data source, required the development of its own method for acquiring and labeling data. The common characteristics among the three developed methods are described in the following subsection. The particularities of each method are detailed in the subsequent subsections.

#### Common Characteristics Among the Methods

All instances, regardless of their type, are related to satellite-type offshore oil-producing wells without manifold [[22]](#22). This type of well can be operated with different lifting methods [[23]](#23) interspersed over time: sometimes with the natural method and sometimes with an artificial lifting method. The natural method can only be used when the reservoir pressure is sufficient to produce hydrocarbons at a commercial rate without requiring any additional energy. Otherwise, some artificial lifting method is required precisely so that extra energy can be added to the system.

Fig. 1 contains a diagram representing the considered scenario when designing the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. This diagram only covers the components necessary for a good understanding of how the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was conceived. In summary, this diagram shows the production platform, the well itself, the subsea Christmas tree [[24]](#24), the production and service lines, the electro-hydraulic umbilical, as well as sensors and valves.

There are 27 variables present in all instances of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. According to the adopted definition of MTS, even if data has not been obtained or generated for a certain variable in a certain instance, that variable is part of that instance. The name of each of these variables, what it represents and its physical position in the considered scenario (see Fig. 1) are presented in Table 2.

**Table 2**<br>Details of the variables in the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.
| **Name** | **Description** | **Position** |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ABER-CKGL | Opening of the GLCK (gas lift choke) | 1.1 |
| ABER-CKP | Opening of the PCK (production choke) | 2.1 |
| ESTADO-DHSV | State of the DHSV (downhole safety valve) | 3.1 |

| P-JUS-CKGL | Downstream pressure of the GLCK | 1.2 |
| P-JUS-CKP | Downstream pressure of the PCK | 2.2 |
| P-MON-CKGL | Upstream pressure of the GLCK | 1.3 |
| P-MON-CKP | Upstream pressure of the PCK | 2.3 |
| P-MON-SDV-P | Upstream pressure of the production SDV | 8.2 |
| P-PDG | Pressure at the PDG (permanent downhole gauge) | 14.1 |
| PT-P | Downstream pressure of the PWV in the production tube | 4.2 |
| P-TPT | Pressure at the TPT (temperature and pressure transducer) | 15.1 |
| QBS | Flow rate at the SP | 13.2 |
| QGL | Gas lift flow rate | 13.3 |
| T-JUS-CKP | Downstream temperature of the PCK | 2.4 |
| T-MON-CKP | Upstream temperature of the PCK | 2.5 |
| T-PDG | Temperature at the PDG | 14.2 |
| T-TPT | Temperature at the TPT | 15.2 |

Note that some variable names contain terms or acronyms in Portuguese. For example: ABER = abertura = opening; CKGL = GLCK; CKP = PCK; ESTADO = state; ANULAR = annulus; JUS = jusante = downstream; and MON = montante = upstream. Translating all these names into English is a pending issue that will be resolved in future versions of 3W Dataset.

All instances were generated with observations taken every 1 second. In other words, the sampling frequency in all instances is fixed at 1 Hz.

All the variables associated with each physical quantity (type of variable) are represented with the same measurement unit according to Table 3.

**Table 3**<br>Physical quantities and their measurement units.
| **Physical Quantity** | **Measurement Unit** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Choke opening | % |
| Flow rate | m<sup>3</sup>/s | 
| Pressure | Pa |
| Temperature | ¬∫C |
| Valve state | Adimensional: 0 for closed, 1 for open, and 0.5 for any other state |

The labeling process applied to all instances of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 resulted in two types of labels, called class labels and state labels. The class labels are directly related to normality or to some undesirable event. The state labels are directly related to the operational status of the well in question. 

The codes associated with the class labels are detailed in Table 4. Any of these codes can be associated with any observation from any instance. Codes 101 to 109 represent transient conditions between normality and steady states referring to undesirable events. It is important to note that not all undesirable events have transient conditions associated with them. When the well condition in terms of the occurrence of an undesirable event or normality is unknown at any time, the associated observation is labeled with the class label Unknown (code = NaN = Not a Number). Each instance as a whole is associated with the only steady state code (1 to 9) to which at least part of its observations have been associated. This code is referenced as type of event.

**Table 4**<br>Class labels and their codes.
| **Code** | **Class Label** |
| -------- | ------- |
| 0 | Normal Operation |
| 1 | Abrupt Increase of BSW |
| 2 | Spurious Closure of DHSV |
| 3 | Severe Slugging |
| 4 | Flow Instability |
| 5 | Rapid Productivity Loss |
| 6 | Quick Restriction in PCK |
| 7 | Scaling in PCK |
| 8 | Hydrate in Production Line |
| 9 | Hydrate in Service Line |
| 101 | Transient: Abruption Increase of BSW |
| 102 | Transient: Spurious Closure of DHSV |
| 105 | Transient: Rapid Productivity Loss |
| 106 | Transient: Quick Restriction in PCK |
| 107 | Transient: Scaling in PCK |
| 108 | Transient: Hydrate in Production Line |
| 109 | Transient: Hydrate in Service Line |
| NaN | Unknown |

The codes associated with the state labels are detailed in Table 5. Any of these codes can also be associated with any observation from any instance. None of these codes are associated with any instance as a whole. When the well operating condition is unknown at any time, the associated observation is labeled with the state label Unknown (code = NaN).

**Table 5**<br>State labels and their codes.
| **Code** | **State Label** |
| -------- | ------- |
| 0 | Open |
| 1 | Shut-In |
| 2 | Flushing Diesel |
| 3 | Flushing Gas |
| 4 | Bullheading |
| 5 | Closed With Diesel |
| 6 | Closed With Gas |
| 7 | Restart |
| 8 | Depressurization |
| NaN | Unknown |

Each operational status is defined according to valve configurations and the nature of recent and/or ongoing operations. In summary, we have the following:

- Open: all production valves (M1, W1, SDV-P, and PCK) are open, and auxiliary valves (PXO, and XO) are closed;
- Shut-in: at least one valve in the production path is closed;
- Flushing Diesel: at least one wellhead valve is closed, PXO or XO is open, and diesel is injected;
- Flushing Gas: at least one wellhead valve is closed, PXO or XO is open, and gas is injected;
- Bullheading: all production valves are open, and diesel is injected from the topside through the production line;
- Closed With Diesel: at least one production valve is closed, and the previous state was Flushing Diesel or Bullheading;
- Closed With Gas: at least one production valve is closed, and the previous state was Flushing Gas;
- Restart: following a shut-in, all production valves are reopened;
- Depressurization: following a shut-in, SDV-P and PCK are open, while M1, W1, PXO, and XO remain closed.

Understanding and correctly identifying these operational status is critical in monitoring and preventing undesirable events. Some important additional explanations are as follows:

- Open state denotes continuous production with all key production path valves open and no auxiliary operations ongoing;
- All operational status other than Open are associated with well Shut-in procedures;
- Closed With Diesel state occurs following successful Flushing Diesel or Bullheading, during which the well is filled with diesel (a condition in which hydrate formation is highly unlikely);
- Bullheading is performed by injecting fluid (diesel) directly from the topside into the production line under pressure, pushing the wellbore fluids back into the reservoir. This operation is used to ensure that a non-hydrate-forming fluid fills the system, often as a preventive action against hydrate plugs;
- Flushing Diesel, in contrast, is performed by circulating diesel through the service line and into the production flowline, displacing the original production fluids along the flowline path, typically toward the topside facilities. This operation ensures that hydrate-prone fluids are replaced with a more stable medium, reducing the chances of hydrate formation during shut-in;
- Closed With Gas state occurs following a Flushing Gas operation, which is performed by injecting and circulating gas (usually dry gas) via the service line into the production line. This operation also serves to remove liquid hydrocarbons or water that could contribute to hydrate formation, creating a drier environment inside the pipeline;
- Additionally, historical operational context can be valuable; for instance, depressurizing the production system is a typical measure performed shortly after the well is shut-in, in order to seek for thermodynamic conditions less favorable to the formation of hydrates;
- Depressurization state may indicate that subcooling levels were reduced, potentially mitigating hydrate risks during extended shut-ins.

#### Method Relating to Real Instances

The particularities of the method developed for real data are listed below.

* Regarding data acquisition:
    1. Data sourced from records in Petrobras' PIMS [[19]](#19), more precisely different AVEVA PI System [[20]](#20) environments;
    1. Linear interpolation provided by the AVEVA PI System to simulate fixed acquisition frequency of 1 Hz;
    1. No preprocessing to adress frozen variables or missing values;
    1. Conversion to standard measurement units.
* Regarding data labeling:
    1. Historical records are mapped in a Tracking System, which ensures accessibility and traceability for Labelers (experts from Petrobras and its partners);
    1. Based on these records, a Labeler conducts the labeling process using a Petrobras' Web Tool developed exclusively for labeling and exporting real data to the 3W Dataset;
    1. An expert committee (Validator) reviews completed labeling to suggest potential adjustments and, ultimately, validate the assigned labels;
    1. A Curator (3W Dataset specialist) finalizes the process by updating the tool to mark the validated events (Instances) as labeled, thereby enabling them to be exported and included in the 3W Dataset;
    1. Fig. 2 illustrates this labeling process and Fig. 3 shows an example of a real instance labeled with this process.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Limited to events that occurred in real life and had archived records;
1. Contextualization (mappings between variables and tags in PIMS) was not verified;
1. Original measurement units configured in PIMS (before conversions) were not verified.

#### Method Relating to Simulated Instances

The particularities of the method developed for simulated data are listed below.

* Regarding data generation:
    1. Planning a matrix of simulations with OLGA [[21]](#21), gradually varying the main parameters of the considered scenario;
    1. Running simulations and filtering out those whose results did not converge (wells that did not produce normally);
    1. Automated extraction of time series from TPL files generated by OLGA and relating to successful simulations;
    1. Perfectly periodic time series;
    1. No frozen variables and missing values;
    1. Variables represented with standardized measurement units;
    1. Absence of any noise in the time series.
* Regarding data labeling:
    1. Fully automated labeling from simulation results (including transient periods).

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Use of a single phenomenological model in OLGA associated with a single well;
1. Use of a simplified simulation strategy. Example: hydrate formation simulated using a valve with a linear closing percentage;
1. As some of the variables were not included in the simulations, all their values are considered missing in all the simulated instances.

#### Method Relating to Hand-Drawn Instances

The particularities of the method developed for hand-drawn data are listed below.

* Regarding data generation:
    1. Proprietary tool based on image processing developed exclusively for generating hand-drawn data for the 3W Dataset;
    1. Each variable was hand-drawn on its own chart by an expert from Petrobras. An example is shown in Fig. 4;
    1. Automated digitization of time series via scanning paper-printed graphs;
    1. Perfectly periodic time series;
    1. No frozen variables or missing values;
    1. Variables represented using standardized measurement units.
* Regarding data labeling:
    1. Derived from the expert markings on the paper-printed graphs (including transient periods).

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Coverage of only well-known signatures of the considered undesirable events;
1. Expert bias when drawing and labeling time series;
1. Dependence on the manual dexterity of the experts.

### Data Records ‚úÖ

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is licensed under CC BY 4.0 [[25]](#25) and is publicly available at the following Figshare [[26]](#26) address: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/3w_v_2.0.0.

An overview of this dataset is presented in the next subsection. Essentially, the main quantities and statistics are covered in this overview. The subsequent subsection details how the data records are structured.

#### 3W Dataset 2.0.0 Overview

The quantities of instances that compose the 3W Dataset 2.0.0, by type of instance and by type of event, are presented in Table 6.

**Table 6**<br>Quantities of instances that compose the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. In brackets are the quantities corresponding to version 1.0.0 and that are different in the current version.

#### 3W Dataset 2.0.0 Structure

In the root of the directory containing the dataset, there is a file called dataset.ini, which specifies properties of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. The proposal is that all users concentrate their searches for these properties in this file.

The data itself in the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is organized in subdirectories dedicated to each type of event. The name of each directory is the code associated with each type of event (see Table 6).

Each instance is persisted in its own Apache Parquet file [[27]](#27), or simply Parquet file, an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high-performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming languages and analytics tools.

The logic used to formulate file names depends on the type of instance.

The name of each real instance is composed as follows: WELL-[incremental id]_[timestamp of oldest observation].parquet. Example: WELL-00014_20170917140000.parquet. Each real well is associated with a unique id, regardless of the type of event (subdirectory). As each real well can give rise to one or multiple instances, the [timestamp of oldest observation] part is needed to uniquely identify them.

The name of each simulated instance is composed as follows: SIMULATED_[incremental id].parquet. Example: SIMULATED_00072.parquet. The incremental id is initialized from 1 for each type of event (subdirectory) and is sufficient to uniquely identify all its simulated instances.

The name of each hand-drawn instance is composed as follows: DRAWN_[incremental id].parquet. Example: DRAWN_00007.parquet. The incremental id is initialized from 1 for each type of event (subdirectory) and is sufficient to uniquely identify all its hand-drawn instances.

All Parquet files are created with the Pyarrow engine [[28]](#28) and the Brotli compression [[29]](#29). These choices were made on the basis of the good compromise between compression ratio and reading time.

The timestamp vector of each instance is used as the index in the corresponding Parquet file. All timestamps are represented in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.

All variables and labels are stored in columns of Parquet files, variables as float and labels as Int64 (not int64).

### Technical Validation ‚úÖ

Several carefully incorporated features in the methods described in the Methods Section ensure the high-technical quality of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. The most relevant are the following:

* In the real instances: preservation of real data characteristics, labeling by experts, and validation by expert committee;
* In the simulated instances: simulation models calibrated by experts, and systematized labeling;
* In the hand-drawn instances: hand-drawn graphs by experts, and systematized labeling.

The experts mentioned here are all from Petrobras and its partners.

The quantity and the diversity of the works developed and published by the 3W Community show the relevance and the high-technical quality of the 3W Dataset. This scientific framework is composed of dozens of published works, including books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs. The quantitative annual progress of these publications to date is shown in Fig. 6. Over the years, the adoption of the 3W Dataset by the 3W Community has steadily increased, highlighting its relevance, accessibility, and practical applicability in advancing AEM systems. More information on these works can be found in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

### Usage Notes ‚úÖ

This data article describes the 3W Dataset 2.0.0, the current publicly available version, and summarizes its evolution with respect to version 1.0.0, which is detailed by Vargas et al. [[8]](#8).

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was generated with code written in Python 3.10 [[18]](#18) and the main used resources were from the Pandas 1.5 [[30]](#30) and Pyarrow 19.0 [[28]](#28) packages. 

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was designed to be explored with essentially any programming language (not just Python). Regardless of the language used, the Apache Parquet files [[27]](#27) must be read with the Pyarrow engine [[28]](#28) and the Brotli compression [[29]](#29).

When comparing results obtained in different works, it is important to note which versions of the 3W Dataset were used. Certain comparisons can be complex due to the significant differences between the versions of the 3W Dataset published so far. 

The main changes incorporated in version 2.0.0 compared to version 1.0.0 are as follows. More details can be found in the release notes available in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).

1. Its structure has been considerably modified. Data is now saved in Parquet files, and no longer in CSV files; 
1. One variable has been discontinued (T-JUS-CKGL) and 20 others have been added, resulting in 27 variables in the current version;
1. One undesirable type of event has been added: Hydrate in Service Line;
1. The number of real instances has increased by 94;
1. The number of simulated instances has increased by 150;
1. The number of real wells covered has increased from 21 to 42;
1. One label has been added: state label;
1. More labeled data (observations) have been incorporated in several instances;
1. No simulated or hand-drawn instances have changed significantly. All 20 additional variables were incorporated into these instances with missing values.

The operational status of a well (indicated with the state label) has a strong relationship with the values of its variables. Therefore, algorithms can be applied to the 3W Dataset to quantify these relationships or the state label can be used to select data for specific training.

### Code Availability ‚úÖ

The 3W Project also develops and makes publicly available in its Git repository [[15]](#15) the 3W Toolkit, which is a software package written in Python 3 [[18]](#18) and licensed under Apache 2.0 [[31]](#31). Its purpose is to facilitate and encourage exploration of the 3W Dataset and proposals for comparative approaches. It provides a range of features for loading data, visualizing time series, calculating metrics, etc.

Python practitioners can therefore use and adapt the 3W Toolkit to speed up their analysis with the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.

An in-depth description of the 3W Toolkit is beyond the scope of this data article, but its documentation and examples of use can be found in the 3W Project repository [[15]](#15).
